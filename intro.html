    <h1>Hello, my name is Lily</h1>
    <p>I am 22 years old, my birthday is May 1. I come from Russia, my city where I was born and grew up is Yakutsk. 
        I came to Mongolia to study at MIU University. At first I wanted to enroll in Business Department, 
        but later I decided that I wanted to study in Computer Science, because this direction interested me more.</p>
    <p>In 2020 I enrolled in English language courses LEI. I studied for 1 academic year, 
        and at the end of the courses I received a 100% scholarship on university tuition, as the best student in the institute.</p>
    <p>I am interested in development, Bible study and love to create useful projects. 
        I'm currently working on an app for students to help them choose classes throughout their 4 years of college, 
        to accumulate the right number of credits to graduate.</p>
